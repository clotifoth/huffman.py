# About
huffman.py is a Python 3 script that takes an input file and compresses using Huffman encoding, saves the encoded file to the output path listed, and then to complete the proof-of-concept, decodes the output from the file to the console. It currently suffers from limitations, such as not currently using binary files to store the tree nor the output, but this could change with the addition of proper file I/O code.

# Installation
To run huffman.py, just clone the Git project, navigate to the folder in your terminal and run using Python 3: `python huffman.py`

# Usage
To run huffman.py, two flags are required.

- `-i [path]` specifies the input file.
- `-o [path]` specifies the output file.

# Contact
